    Print API SQS Message Types
    
    Whilst this is an openAPI spec, it does not imply being used to define REST APIs, nor is it intended to.
    
    The `paths` elements are being used to document (at a high level) the SQS queues and the request bodies that are expected
    to be published to them. **There is no intent to generate or implement SQS queues or listener classes from this document.**
    
    The `paths` element is only being used in order to maintain the structure of the openApi spec, as `paths` are required 
    elements.
