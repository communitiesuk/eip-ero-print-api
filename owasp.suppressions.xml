            Fixed in 2.14.0

            Package imported by the `jsonschema2pojo` plugin before 1.2.2.
            jsonschema2dataclass:6.0.0 imports jsonschema2pojo:1.1.2.

            jsonschema2dataclass has not had a release since Jan 2023,
            so the suppression date has been set until Q1 2026

            The org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader class may excessively consume CPU resources when
            processing maliciously crafted input.
            The inputs we provide do not result in this issue.

            No available fix at the time of writing.

            so the suppression date has been set until Q1 2026

            The attack requires a maliciously crafted yaml spec,
            which would require write access to the source code.
