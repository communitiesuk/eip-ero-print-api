            The method with the vulnerability is deprecated now, but not removed yet.
            It will be removed as part of Spring 6.
            The warning is suppressed until then.

            The vulnerability is on Spring HTTP Invoker, and it is deprecated by Spring, but not removed yet.
            It is not used in our code base and seen as a JVM deserialization issue rather than a Spring one by the Spring team.
            It doesn't look like it will be address any time soon, and since we don't use it, it is suppressed as well.

            This vulnerability is on Snakeyaml's Constructor class, where the advice is to use Snakeyaml's SafeConstructor class instead.
            Spring Boot already uses Snakeyaml's SafeConstructor class, and the content of the parsed yaml (application.yml)
            is considered trusted.
